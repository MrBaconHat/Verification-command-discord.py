There's nothing much for you to know. 


The script in main.py creates a verification command inside your bot for your server members.


The command comes with a option that'll ask you to select a verification channel. Inside the selected channel a button will be sent. The button will be a verification button


when button is pressed the code will generate a random code for users to type in the form.


remember to install discord and requests module in your terminal/shell by typing "pip install discord" and "pip install requests"


the code might get updates in the future so stay tuned :]
