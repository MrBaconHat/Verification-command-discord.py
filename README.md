There's nothing much for you to know. 

The command in main.py allows you to make a verification command for your server members in your bot. 

The command will come with the option that'll ask you to select a verification channel. Inside the selected channel a button will be sent

when button is pressed the code will generate a random code for users to type in the form.

remember to install discord and requests module in your terminal/shell by typing "pip install discord" and "pip install requests"

the code might get updates in the future so stay tuned :]
